## System description

You have acquired the following system description for a table reservation system in a restaurant.

When a customer calls to reserve a table, the receptionist enters the date of the requested reservation, the number of expected diners and the time of their arrival. If there is a suitably sized table available at that time, the table number, the number of diners, a contact name, and a phone number of the customer are recorded.  Otherwise, the customer's request may be entered into a waiting list.

The customer may cancel a reservation.

The receptionist should be able to check if customers in the waiting list may be served. In that case they are being called and if they agree they reserve an available table.

When the customer arrives he is seated at the reserved table and their arrival is recorded by the waiter.  The customer may request from the waiter a table transfer if another suitable table is available.  

The system can display all reservations for a specific date and a specific date/time.
