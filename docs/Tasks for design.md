# Design tasks

For the tasks below, create and work in a `design` branch. (Before creating the new branch from `main`, make sure that you have merged the `analysis` branch into your `main` branch).

All the tasks below should be presented in the file: `Design.md`

1. For two of the most complex system operations identified in the System Sequence Diagram(s) that you created during analysis, create 
    - a sequence diagram and 
    - a Design Class.
2. Convert the most complex sequence diagram to a communication diagram.
3. Create a single Design Class Diagram incorporating all information from all interaction diagrams of task 1.

Diagrams can be created either by using a tool or may be hand-drawn. Images of the diagrams should be commited and pushed in the repository in the `docs/img` folder. Make sure that resolution and size of the images make the diagram readable in the markdown files without needing to scroll.

Links to the diagrams should be placed inside the `Design.md`.  

When you have completed, create a Pull Request with me as a reviewer in order to provide feedback.

Add appropriate text in your `Design.md` file to explain any assumptions or decisions you made during the construction of the artefacts.

Pay attention to professional presentation.
