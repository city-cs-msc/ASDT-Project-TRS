# Analysis tasks

For the tasks below create and work in an `analysis` branch.

All the tasks below should be presented in the file: `Analysis.md`

1. Create a use case diagram.
2. Write in fully dressed format the Use case texts for the two most imporant use cases.
3. Create one System Sequence Diagram for each of main success scenarios of the main use cases.
4. Create a Conceptual Class Diagram.

Diagrams can be created either by using a tool or may be hand-drawn. Images of the diagrams should be commited and pushed in the repository in the docs/img folder. Make sure that resolution and size of the images make the diagram readable in the markdown files without needing to scroll.

Links to the diagrams should be placed inside the `Analysis.md` file as in the example.  

Use case texts should be written in markdown format within the `Analysis.md` file.

When you have completed, create a Pull Request with me as a reviewer in order to provide feedback.

Add appropriate text in your `Analysis.md` file to explain any assumptions or decisions you made during the construction of the artefacts.

Pay attention to professional presentation.
